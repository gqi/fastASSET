# Simulation studies

`01_null_simulations.R`: Simulations under the global null hypothesis (SNP is associated with none of the traits) to evaluate type I error control.

`02_power_simulations.R`: Non-null simulations where some of the traits have true association with the SNP. This script is used to evaluate power and accuracy of pleiotropy estimation.
